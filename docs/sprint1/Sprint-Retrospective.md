# Sprint Retrospective Meeting Minutes

**Date:** 19 August 2025
**time:** 33 Minutes
**Platform:** In person meeting  
**Attendees:** All team members were present  

---

## Discussion Points

1. **Commit Conventions**
   - Everyone must write proper commit messages following the conventions outlined in the **Standards Document**.

2. **Task Dependencies**
   - If a team member's task depends on yours, ensure you complete your work on time to avoid blocking others.

3. **Frontend Folder Structure**
   - Structure the `frontend` folder properly.  
   - Create a dedicated **tests folder** instead of placing test files inside the `pages` folder.

4. **Pull Requests**
   - Always create pull requests (PRs) before merging changes.  
   - This prevents untested code from being pushed directly into the `dev` branch.

5. **Test Coverage**
   - Write tests for every page or component you work on to improve quality and coverage.

6. **File Naming**
   - Follow the agreed **naming conventions** for files consistently.

7. **Progress Tracking**
   - Update progress regularly in **GitHub Projects** under the relevant task.  
   - If you encounter a bug, move the task to the **Bugs** column so others can assist in fixing it.

## What Went Well 
- Team collaboration.  
- Clearer understanding of Git workflows (branches, pull requests, merging).  
- Most members contributed commits to the repository.  
- Initial test cases were created for some frontend components.  
- Project board helped in tracking tasks and responsibilities.  

## What Can Be Improved 
- Commit messages must strictly follow the agreed Standards.  
- Some tasks were delayed, affecting dependent tasks â€” deadlines need to be respected.  
- Frontend folder structure requires cleanup (tests should not be inside `pages`).  
- Tests are not consistently written for all pages.  
- File naming conventions are not always followed.  
- Some pull requests were skipped, and code was pushed directly to `dev`.  
- GitHub Projects updates were inconsistent, and bugs were not always tracked in the **Bugs** column.

**Next Steps:**  
Ensure that the above points are followed in the upcoming sprint to improve efficiency, maintain code quality, and support team collaboration.
