# Hiking Logbook Public API Documentation

## Overview

The Hiking Logbook Public API lets you access hiking data and statistics from our platform. You can use it to build apps, websites, or other projects that need hiking information.

## Getting Started

- **Base URL**: `https://hiking-logbook-hezw.onrender.com` (Production) | `http://localhost:3001` (Development)
- **API Version**: 1.0.0
- **Documentation**: [Interactive Swagger UI](/api-docs)
- **Authentication**: API Key (for write operations)

## Available Endpoints

### Public Endpoints (No Authentication Required)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| `GET` | `/api/public/health` | Check if the API is working |
| `GET` | `/api/public/stats` | Global hiking statistics across all users|
| `GET` | `/api/public/badges` | See available achievement badges |
| `GET` | `/api/public/locations` | Get popular hiking locations |

### Protected Endpoints (API Key Required)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/public/hikes` | Submit hike data from external systems |
| `GET` | `/api/public/key-info` | Get information about your API key |

## Authentication

Most endpoints don't need authentication. Only when you want to submit hike data do you need an API key.

**Test API Keys:**
- **Full Access**: `demo-key-12345` (can read and submit data)
- **Read Only**: `readonly-key-67890` (can only read data)

**How to use API Keys:**
Add this header to your request:
```
X-API-Key: demo-key-12345
```

## Response Format

### Success Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "message": "Operation successful"
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error type",
  "message": "Detailed error message"
}
```
