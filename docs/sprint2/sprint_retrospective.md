# Sprint Retrospective 

**Date:** 29 August 2025 
**Platform:** Google Meet
**Attendees:** Naledi, Risuna, Annah, Naledi, Jane

## Sprint Goal
The goal of this sprint was to continue building the **Hiking Logbook** system, focusing on the Logbook page, its functionality, and related integrations.

---

## What Could Be Improved 
- Initial task assignments were not well-balanced, did not correspond to sprint2's rubric.
- Testing and code coverage were delayed because setup of Firebase emulators caused blockers.
- Documentation of database schema and API endpoints will be improved for clarity.

## Task Reassignments 
During this sprint retrospective, we reallocated tasks to improve workflow and balance responsibilities:

- **Ntokozo** → Assigned to **Database Schema** for the Hiking Logbook.
- **Risuna** → Completed the **Design and Frontend** of the Logbook page.
- **Naledi** → Took charge of the **Hiking Logbook API**.
- **Jane** → Worked on the **Weather API integration**.
- **Annah** → Implemented **Filter and Search functionality**.

## Action Items 
1. Finalize and test the Hiking Logbook database schema with Firebase.
2. Create clearer documentation for API endpoints and database schema.
3. Work on integration between backend and frontend so that all features connect smoothly.
5. Continue improving team collaboration and task distribution.
