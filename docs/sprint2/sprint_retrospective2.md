## What Went Well
- Team collaborated well to resolve issues as they arose.  
- We managed to deliver features despite time constraints.  
- Communication was active and responsive throughout the sprint.  

---

## What Did Not Go Well
- We **overloaded ourselves with too many tasks** that could not be completed within the sprint timeline.  
- Tasks had to be **reassigned last minute**, which caused confusion and disrupted workflow.  
- **User feedback was done late**, leaving little time to properly integrate the changes.  
- Updating features according to user feedback also had to be done in a rush, affecting quality.  

---

## Lessons Learned
- Proper planning and realistic task allocation are critical to avoid overloading team members.  
- User feedback should be conducted earlier in the sprint to leave sufficient time for changes.  
- Last-minute task switching should be avoided by having clearer priorities at sprint planning.

## Action Items for Sprint 3
- Ensure **better planning and realistic task distribution** during Sprint Planning.  
- **Finish tasks earlier** to allow time for proper testing and user feedback.  
- Allocate **dedicated time** towards the end of the sprint for feature updates based on feedback.  
- Track task progress more closely in GitHub Projects to avoid delays.  

---
**Next Steps:** Sprint 3 will focus on backend stability and frontend integration, with improved planning to ensure all tasks are completed on time.
