## Discussion Points  

### Decisions Taken 
- Remove **"Continue with Facebook"** button on the login page.  
- Rename the **Logbook** page to **Homepage**.  
- Redesign the **Login page** for better user experience.  
- Add a **flash/animation effect** to the **Signup** and **Login** buttons.  

### Items Needing Clarification 
- Define the exact UI/UX design changes for the new **Login page**.  
- Confirm whether the Homepage will display recent hikes, user stats, or both.  
- Decide on the type of animation for Signup/Login buttons.  
- Clarify whether removing Facebook login requires backend cleanup (API keys, OAuth configs).  

### Estimations & Task Breakdown 
- Story points must be assigned for each of the new items.  
- Large user stories (e.g., “Redesign login page”) should be broken into smaller tasks:
  - Update frontend layout  
  - Adjust form validation  
  - Connect API endpoints  
  - Write test cases  

### Dependencies & Risks 
- Renaming **Logbook → Homepage** may require updating navigation, routes, and documentation.    
- Animations should be lightweight to avoid performance issues on low-end devices.  

### Reprioritization 
- Login-related tasks are **high priority** since they affect user access.  
- Homepage renaming is **medium priority** but must be aligned with navigation updates.  
- Animations are **low-medium priority** (nice-to-have, but not blocking).

## Action Items
-  Remove Facebook button (frontend + backend cleanup if necessary).  
-  Rename Logbook page to Homepage in all places (UI + navigation + docs).  
-  Redesign Login page (create mockups, review, then implement).  
-  Add flash/animation feature to Signup/Login buttons.  
-  Assign story points and update GitHub Project board.  
-  Break down large tasks into smaller subtasks.  
-  Review dependencies and adjust sprint plan if needed.

Finalized backlog items will be moved into the upcoming sprint, with clear acceptance criteria, estimations, and priorities.
