# Daily Standup 4

**Date:** 12 September 2025

## Discussion Summary
- **Ntokozo** and **Annah** encountered issues with testing:  
  - `curl` testing for API endpoints was passing.  
  - However, several **unit tests were failing**, requiring further debugging.  
- **Naledi** is also focusing on tests and discovered that **CodeCov** is not covering backend tests, raising concerns about reporting accuracy.  
- **Jane** is experiencing difficulties pushing to her branch, which is blocking her from creating a pull request.  

## Key Notes
- Testing inconsistencies between manual `curl` requests and automated unit tests need urgent resolution.  
- Code coverage reports are currently unreliable, affecting test quality tracking.  
- Git workflow issues (Janeâ€™s push problem) are slowing progress on her tasks.  

## Next Steps
- Debug and resolve the failing unit tests to ensure parity with curl testing.  
- Investigate CodeCov configuration to properly include backend test coverage.  
- Provide Jane with Git support to resolve branch push issues and unblock her pull request.
