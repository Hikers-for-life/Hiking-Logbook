# Sprint 3 Retrospective

## What Went Well
- **Team Collaboration:** The group worked efficiently together, maintaining good communication and coordination through GitHub and weekly meetings.  
- **API Integration:** Successful integration between the backend and frontend ensured that user data flowed correctly through the system.  
- **Client Meeting Feedback:** The client appreciated the progress and particularly liked the new feature implementations, such as user authentication and hike logging.  
- **Testing:** Unit and integration tests were successfully implemented, improving the reliability of our application.

## What Could Be Improved
- **Time Management:** The team occasionally faced delays in merging branches due to pull request conflicts, which slowed progress.  
- **Design Consistency:** Some frontend pages lacked consistent styling at first; this was later corrected but required extra time.  

## Next Steps
- Begin **Sprint 4** with a focus on final polish and deployment stability.  
- Conduct final user testing and collect feedback through a Google Form.  
- Prepare final project documentation.
