#### **1. Risuna**

  - **Current Status:** Once backend API fix is deployed, will resume integration.

#### **3. Jane**
- **Backend:**
  - **Blocker:** The weather API has **request limits**, and frequent testing has caused the API to temporarily block further requests.

---

### **Next Steps:**  
- Address blockers and bugs before proceeding with the implementation of other pages.
- Follow up in the next standup to see if any blockers remain unresolved.
