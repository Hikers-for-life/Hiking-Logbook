# Strategy Roadmap
This document aligns our vision, process, and delivery for the Hiking Logbook. It covers methodology, user stories with acceptance tests, goals & alignment, development roadmap, and our project structure.

## 1. Project Structure
Our structure is designed to support **clarity, scalability, collaboration, and maintainability**.
---

### üñ•Ô∏è `frontend/`

- Contains the **React.js frontend application**.
- All user-facing code lives here (UI components, routing, styling, state management).
- Separated from backend to:
  - Keep the UI codebase lightweight and modular.
  - Allow frontend developers to work independently.
  - Enable deployment to Firebase Hosting without including backend logic.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è `backend/`

- Contains the **Firebase backend application** (Cloud Functions, server logic, API endpoints).
- Responsible for:
  - Authentication & security (via Firebase Auth).
  - Storing data (via Firestore).
  - Providing REST APIs consumed by the frontend.
- Separation from frontend ensures:
  - Clear distinction between **client-side** and **server-side** logic.
  - Easier maintenance and scaling.
  - Supports future microservices-oriented design.

---

### üìñ `docs/`

- Dedicated space for **project documentation**.
- Includes:
  - A README with a table of content of all the documents in the docs file.
  - All the project documents.
- Separating documentation ensures it doesn‚Äôt clutter code folders and makes it easy for new contributors to onboard.

---

### ‚úÖ Benefits of This Structure

1. **Clarity** ‚Üí Clear separation of concerns (frontend, backend, docs, tests).  
2. **Scalability** ‚Üí Each part can grow independently .  
3. **Collaboration** ‚Üí Different team members can work in parallel without conflicts.  
4. **Maintainability** ‚Üí Easier debugging and refactoring since responsibilities are separated.  
5. **CI/CD Friendly** ‚Üí Branch rules and pipelines can run targeted checks (lint, tests, coverage) for each part.
6. This structure is flexible enough to support future growth.

---

This project structure follows **modern full-stack best practices** and aligns with the **Agile workflow and CI/CD pipelines** used by the team.


## 2. Project Management Methodology

### Agile (Scrum-Based Approach)
We have chosen **Agile (Scrum-based)** as our project management methodology. Agile allows us to work iteratively, adapt to changing requirements, and deliver value to users continuously. This is particularly important for our Hiking Logbook project, where user feedback and evolving features will shape the product.

**Why Agile (Scrum)?**
- Encourages collaboration within the team and with stakeholders.
- Allows us to deliver functional increments of the product after each sprint.
- Provides flexibility to adjust scope and priorities based on feedback.
- Focuses on user needs through user stories and acceptance criteria.
- Reduces risks by identifying and addressing challenges early.

**How We Will Implement Scrum:**
- **Sprints**: The first sprint is on the 19th of August and we should deliver the project setup and initial designs, the second sprint is on the 2nd of September and we should deliver the first features being implemented, the third sprint is on the 29th of September and we should deliver the final features being implemented, and the forth sprint is on the 19th of October and our website should be complete by then and bug-free.
- **Ceremonies**:
  - *Sprint Planning*: We meet at the start of each sprint to set a Sprint Goal and select backlog items that align with capacity and priority and breakdown our user stories into tasks where each and everyone of us is assigned a task on github projects.
  - *Daily Standups*: We hold our meetings on WhatsApp to track progress, plans, and blockers. We capture proof of meetings.
  - *Sprint Review*: Demo completed features to client. We collect feedback and adjust the Product Backlog priorities.
  - *Sprint Retrospective*: We meet at the end of each sprint to reflect on what went well, what can improve, and agree on actionable improvements for the next sprint.
  - *Backlog Refinement*: We have a session to clarify, split, and estimate upcoming user stories and prioritise certain backlog items over others.
- **Roles**:
  - *Scrum Master*, Ntokozo Skosana: facilitates the scrum process.
  - *Development Team*, Risuna Ntimana, Naledi Mogomotsi, Stelly Jane, Annah Mlimi, Ntokozo Skosana: Responsible for delivering features.
