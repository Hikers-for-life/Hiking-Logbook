# Project Structure 

This document explains the reasoning behind the chosen **GitHub project structure** for the Hiking-Logbook application. Our structure is designed to support **clarity, scalability, collaboration, and maintainability**.

---


---

## üñ•Ô∏è `frontend/`

- Contains the **React.js frontend application**.
- All user-facing code lives here (UI components, routing, styling, state management).
- Separated from backend to:
  - Keep the UI codebase lightweight and modular.
  - Allow frontend developers to work independently.
  - Enable deployment to Firebase Hosting without including backend logic.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è `backend/`

- Contains the **Firebase backend application**.
- Responsible for:
  - Authentication & security (via Firebase Auth).
  - Storing data (via Firestore).
  - Providing REST APIs consumed by the frontend.
- Separation from frontend ensures:
  - Clear distinction between **client-side** and **server-side** logic.
  - Easier maintenance and scaling.
  - Supports future microservices-oriented design.

---

## üìñ `docs/`

- Dedicated space for **project documentation**.
- Includes:
  - A README, explaining the Hiking-Logbook documentation with a table of content of all the documentations in the docs folder.
  - All the project documents.
- Separating documentation ensures it doesn‚Äôt clutter code folders and makes it easy for new contributors to onboard.
